## Introduction
<img src="assets/framework.png" width = 70% div align=center />

## Requirements
- PyTorch >= 1.3
- gcc >= 6.0

## Start
```bash
# install requirements
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# install depth-aware part association lib (c++ and cuda)
# requirement: gcc >= 6
cd extensions
# make the cuda path in setup.py right
python setup.py install
```

## Run inference on custom images
Our pretrained model can be downloaded from [SMAP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnasBCucFA39hy3SBZVFdb2EzLtmes9z/view?usp=sharing) and [RefineNet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m4zvXw0dWj-ZnCwCp4RRHUYkEWRP8pJ-/view?usp=sharing).  
```bash
cd exps/stage3_root2
# vim test.sh
# set dataset_path
# set -t run_inference
# set -d test
bash test.sh
```
The result will be saved in a json file located in "model_logs/stage3_root2/result/". You can use the visualization code in "lib/visualize". Note that when evaluation, we will reproject the 2D keypoints again with the refined depths if RefineNet is used, because RefineNet may change the strict projection constraint.

## Prepare Data for training  
Put all data under the "data/" folder with symbolic link according to the specified directory structure. Or you can change the path in "dataset/data_settings.py".
```
$PROJECT_HOME
|-- data
|   |-- coco2017
|   |   |-- annotations
|   |   |-- train2017
|   |-- MuCo
|   |   |-- annotations
|   |   |-- images
|   |-- ...
```    
Sources: MuCo is provided by [Moon](https://github.com/mks0601/3DMPPE_POSENET_RELEASE).  
Only the mpi15 skeleton is supported for all stages now. Our data formats (annotation json, keypoint ordering, etc.) are in [lib/preprocess/data_format.md](lib/preprocess/data_format.md). We convert all datasets to our format. 

## Train
```bash
# step 1: train smap network
cd exps/stage3_root2
# vim train.sh
# change the $PROJECT_HOME to the absolute path of the project
# set $CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES and nproc_per_node if using distributed training
bash train.sh

# step 2: generate training data for refinenet
# vim test.sh
# set -t generate_train
# set -d generation (if using training data); -d test (if using test data)
bash test.sh

# step 3: train refinenet
cd exps/refinenet_root2
bash train.sh
```

到时候做动作数据集的时候需要转化到世界坐标系吗？？
我觉得应该不用的吧，反正都是识别出来就好了
转化到世界坐标系中只是为了便于后面的发布和距离计算等 。。。
